# :gear: Neovim

Hello! :wave: I present you my own Neovim configuration written entirely in Lua and this is an achievement for me since it cost me a lot to learn how to use this editor, since I had never used it before and I really like it :+1:.

I have learned by reading the [official documentation](https://neovim.io/doc/user/) :bookmark_tabs: and looking at configurations from other people who already know how to use it to see how they do it.

## :zap: Requirements

- Neovim >= **0.8.0** (needs to be built with **LuaJIT**)
- Git >= **2.19.0** (for partial clones support)
- A Nerd Font (optional)

## :hammer_and_pick: Installation

#### Make a backup of your current nvim and shared folder

```bash
mv ~/.config/nvim ~/.config/nvim.bak
mv ~/.local/share/nvim ~/.local/share/nvim.bak
```

#### Clone the repository
